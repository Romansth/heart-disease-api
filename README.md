# Heart Disease Prediction API


This repository contains source code of our project for Provathon.  Heart Disease Prediction API is Machine Learning based solution to predict risks of heart disease using a integrable API.


# Description

Our solution is based on microservices architecture and the AI Model can be independently used in any other platform with ease. We've also included a demo dashboard of our smart watch simulator where we can receive patient's real time health data directly from his smart watch and use those value to get a realtime prediction  of immediate risks of heart attacks in a patient. This real time prediction is  also simulated in a continuous graph to warn the patients in case of any risks.<br>
In similar way, our api can be integrated with any smart watches, hospital management system, health apps to get a real time prediction of immediate risks of heart attacks.

```

### Response

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "value":"92",
  "risk":true,
}
```

**status** : If any error occured in backend it will say error else it will be set to success. <br>
**value** : Confidence measure of the AI Model. <br>
**risk** : boolean value which says if the risk of heart disease is high ( default threshold is 75% ) 


# Installation of WebApp.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Romansth/heart-disease-api.git
cd heart-disease-api/backend
pip install django requests numpy pickle django-cors-headers 
python manage.py
```

After running these commands, the blog will be hosted and you will be ready to test the endpoint.

# Installation of AI Model

```bash
cd heart-disease-api/AI_Models
pip install flask pickle numpy flask-cors
python Deployed_Flask_App.py
```
After running these commands, the AI Model will be hosted on your machine. And you can go to /predict/<data> to test your endpoint.
